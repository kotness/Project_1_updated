    <h1>Kanye West</h1>
 Kanye Omari West was raised in the middle-class background of the Chicago city by 
 his highly educated mother Donda West. He had a knack for creativity and poetry from 
 a very young age. He started rapping from the age of 7 and soon confessed to his mother
 that he wanted to take recording music more formally. When he was 20, he decided to drop
 out of college and pursue music professionally. His mother supported him in his endeavors.
 He started as a small time producer until he met Jay-Z and produced his ‘The Blueprint’ for him.
 Since that time West started getting recognition and he worked with talented people like Ludacris,
 Janet Jackson, Alicia Keys, etc. But West’s main aspiration was to become a rapper and it was not
  until the year 2002 that he was given his first opportunity to record his solo album.
